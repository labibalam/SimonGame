The Simon Memory Game
This is one of my first projects that I created. It's based on an old board game
called Simon. Simply make note of the pattern that is displayed on the screen and
then enter the pattern by clicking on the appropriate colours.

Download Instructions:
Please download all the files into one folder anywhere on your desktop/laptop.
Upon doing so, select the index.html file and open the file with any browser of 
your choice. Once opened, follow the instructions on screen.

Game Instructions:
The screen has four buttons of different colours. The buttons will flash in a certain
pattern and your task is to remember that pattern. After the buttons have flashed, your
task is to click the buttons in the order that they flashed. Upon successful completion, 
you will move onto the next level, where the game will continue to build on the existing
colour pattern, forcing you to put your memory skills to the test. Continue to enter the
correct pattern to move onto the next level, but if you fail to do so, you will be 
forced to start over from Level 1.

Be sure to have fun and enjoy! :D
