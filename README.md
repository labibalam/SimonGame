# SimonGame
The Simon Memory Game
//This is one of my first projects that I created. It's based on an old board game
//called Simon. Simply make note of the pattern that is displayed on the screen and
//then enter the pattern by clicking on the appropriate colours.

//If successful, you will move onto the next level and the pattern will become longer
//and more complex. Otherwise, you will lose and will be forced to start over.

//Be sure to have fun and enjoy! :D
